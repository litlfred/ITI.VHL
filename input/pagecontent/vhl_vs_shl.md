| 1\. Transmission Method                  | In Spec:<br>Defined as a URL that points to internet‐accessible storage (e.g., a FHIR server).<br>Examples in Practice:<br>The URL may be shared via a QR code.<br>Embedding the entire IPS in a QR code is a feature of the SMART Health Cards framework—not part of the core SHLink spec.                                                           | In Spec:<br>The VHL specification defines a URL that references a document stored in an IHE-compliant repository (e.g., XDS, MHD).<br>QR codes are used to convey that URL or document reference.                                                                                                                                                                             | HL7: [SMART App Launch](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html) VHL: [IHE VHL Volume 1](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.VHL/volume-1.html)                                                                                |
| 2\. Verifying URL Safety                 | In Spec:<br>The specification does not mandate a specific method for verifying URL safety.<br>Examples in Practice:<br>Implementations typically rely on standard HTTPS/TLS for domain authentication.<br>Some systems may check an issuer (iss) claim and use JWKS (as seen in SMART Health Cards), but that is not defined in the core SHLink spec. | In Spec:<br>URL safety is ensured via the pre-established trust network where digital signatures are verified against exchanged PKI material.<br>The specification defines mechanisms to retrieve and verify PKI material via a Trust Anchor.                                                                                                                                 | HL7: [SMART App Launch](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html) (no mandated URL verification method) VHL: [IHE VHL Volume 1 – Security Considerations](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.VHL/volume-1.html)                |
| 3\. Issuance of Sender Credentials       | In Spec:<br>There is no formal requirement for credential issuance in SHLink.<br>Optional Implementation:<br>Systems may choose to sign payloads using JWS with public keys published via a JWKS endpoint (as seen in SMART Health Cards).                                                                                                            | In Spec:<br>The VHL framework requires that the sender use PKI credentials issued by a trusted authority as part of a pre-defined trust network.<br>While the spec refers to exchanging and verifying PKI material via a Trust Anchor, in practice this is typically implemented using X.509 certificates, even though the document does not always state “X.509” explicitly. | HL7 (Optional): [SMART Health Cards Overview](https://smarthealth.cards/) VHL: [IHE VHL Volume 1 – Actors & Transactions](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.VHL/volume-1.html#xx-1.1-actors)                                          |
| 4\. Receiver Credentials for Access      | In Spec:<br>No specific receiver credentials are mandated, possession of the URL grants access.<br>Optional:<br>Implementations may add a passcode/PIN for additional security.<br>CA:SHL guidance defines passcode as mandatory.                                                                                                                     | In Spec:<br>The receiver must be an authorized participant in the trust network and be verified using their PKI credentials (typically implemented as X.509 certificates).<br>Access is controlled by repository permissions within the trust framework.<br>Additional security measures (e.g., passcodes) are available as options.                                          | HL7: [SMART App Launch](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html) VHL: [IHE VHL Volume 1 – Actors & Transactions](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.VHL/volume-1.html)                                                        |
| 5\. Document Integrity Verification      | In Spec:<br>The SHLink specification does not mandate a specific mechanism for document integrity verification.<br>Optional Implementation:<br>Some systems may use JWS signatures and dynamically fetch public keys via a JWKS endpoint (as seen in SMART Health Cards) to verify integrity; however, this is not required by SHLink.                | In Spec:<br>The VHL specification mandates that document integrity is verified using digital signatures based on exchanged PKI material.<br>The signature is validated by checking the certificate chain against a recognized Trust Anchor, ensuring the document has not been modified since signing.                                                                        | HL7 (Optional): [RFC7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515) & [RFC7517](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) VHL: [IHE VHL Volume 1 – Document Signature](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.VHL/volume-1.html) |
| 6\. Unauthorized Access Prevention       | In Spec:<br>Access is granted solely by possession of the URL.<br>Optional:<br>Additional measures (e.g., encryption or a passcode) may be implemented by the application, but these are not defined by the core SHLink spec.<br>CA:SHL guidance defines passcode, encryption, and short-lived URL as mandatory.                                      | In Spec:<br>The VHL specification requires that access to the document is controlled via repository permissions enforced within the trust network.<br>Only authorized participants (as verified by the trust framework) can retrieve the document.                                                                                                                            | HL7: [SMART Health Cards Overview](https://smarthealth.cards/) (for optional enhancements) VHL: [IHE VHL Volume 1 – Security Considerations](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.VHL/volume-1.html)                                     |
| 7\. Predefined Relationship Requirements | In Spec:<br>There is no requirement for a pre-established trust relationship between sender and receiver in SHLink.<br>Trust is established dynamically using standard web security (e.g., HTTPS).                                                                                                                                                    | In Spec:<br>The VHL framework requires that both sender and receiver be part of a pre-established trust network.<br>Their identities must be verified against a common Trust Anchor, ensuring mutual trust across jurisdictions.                                                                                                                                              | HL7: [SMART App Launch](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html) VHL: [IHE VHL Volume 1 – Actors & Transactions](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.VHL/volume-1.html)                                                        |
| 8\. Consent Recording                    | In Spec:<br>The SHLink specification does not include mechanisms for formal consent recording.<br>Optional:<br>Implementations may integrate consent recording using external systems or components from related standards (e.g., SMART Health Cards or FHIR-based consent modules).<br>Considering adding explicit consent to CA:SHL in future       | In Spec (Option):<br>The VHL specification provides an optional Record Consent Option (e.g., via integration with IHE Privacy Consent on FHIR (PCF)).<br>This option enables capturing and referencing patient consent as part of the VHL transaction.                                                                                                                        | HL7: [SMART Health Cards Overview](https://smarthealth.cards/) (does not mandate consent recording) VHL: [IHE VHL Volume 1 – Section XX.2.2 Record Consent Option](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.VHL/volume-1.html)               |
| 9\. Audit Logging                        | In Spec:• Audit logging is not mandated by the SHLink specification.Optional:• Systems may choose to implement logging externally at the receiver’s side if desired.<br>Considering adding explicit audit requirement to CA:SHL in future                                                                                                             | In Spec (Option):<br>The VHL specification includes an optional Audit Event Option(typically implemented using IHE ATNA profiles) to log document access and transaction events.<br>This supports security audits and regulatory compliance.                                                                                                                                  | HL7: [SMART App Launch](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html) (no audit requirement) VHL: [IHE VHL Volume 1 – Section XX.2.3 Audit Event Option](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.VHL/volume-1.html)                     |
| 10\. Criteria for Choosing the Standard  | In Spec:<br>SHLink is designed for simpler, ad hoc, patient-initiated sharing scenarios without formal trust networks.<br>It is intended for use cases where minimal infrastructure is desired.<br>Consideration:<br>Suitable when regulatory requirements for trust and auditing are less stringent.                                                 | In Spec:<br>VHL is intended for use in regulated, cross-jurisdictional environments where explicit trust, and optional consent recording and audit logging, are important.<br>Best used when participants are part of a pre-established trust network with formal PKI (typically implemented using X.509 certificates).                                                       | HL7: [SMART Health Cards Overview](https://smarthealth.cards/)(provides context for simple sharing) VHL: [IHE VHL Volume 1 – Use Cases](https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.VHL/volume-1.html)                                          |
